				"NARRATOR: The first coffin yields a woman in corroded plate armor — a knight-commander, by the heraldry. Federica kneels beside the remains, produces a leather case of surgical instruments, and inserts three long needles into precise points along the skull.
FEDERICA: Stand back.
NARRATOR: The corpse convulses. A sound comes from it — not speech, not yet. A wet, whistling shriek through a throat half-collapsed with rot.
THE KNIGHT: (thrashing, clawing at her own ruined face) — it BURNS — what have you — I was SLEEPING —
FEDERICA: You served under General Maratesta. You campaigned against Emperor Regalus in the Year of Broken Standards.
THE KNIGHT: (weeping without tears, without eyes) I can feel my bones — they're wrong — everything is WRONG —
FEDERICA: His weaknesses. His habits in battle. Speak and I will let you sleep again.
THE KNIGHT: He... he never took the field himself. Always proxies. We never saw him bleed. Not once. We thought it cowardice — we were fools — please, PLEASE —
NARRATOR: Federica withdraws the needles. The corpse drops like a puppet cut from its strings. She records something in a small notebook, expression unchanged.
FEDERICA: Verhoeven. The next one.
VERHOEVEN: Outstanding, Ma'am.

NARRATOR: The second coffin holds a robed man — a court astrologer, judging by the celestial charts crumbling against his chest. The needles go in. He wakes screaming.
THE ASTROLOGER: MY HANDS — I can't feel my — no, I CAN feel them, I can feel them ROTTING —
FEDERICA: You served in the court of Regalus. You were executed for treason. Why?
THE ASTROLOGER: (shuddering, jaw clicking loose and resetting with each word) I cast his — his true horoscope. Not the man's. The thing beneath the man. The stars don't lie — they said his birth was — thousands of years before the — oh gods, my teeth are falling into my stomach —
FEDERICA: What did you learn?
THE ASTROLOGER: Fire. He IS fire. But old fire — banked coals — he's been burning so long he's mostly ash — find the ash — find where he keeps —
NARRATOR: His jaw detaches fully. Federica catches it, examines it briefly, then sets it aside and withdraws the needles. She makes another note.
FEDERICA: Promising. Verhoeven — the deep one now.

NARRATOR: The third coffin is older than the others — black oak, iron-banded, buried deep. Verhoeven's shovel cracks the lid and something inside cracks back.
VERHOEVEN: ...Ma'am?
NARRATOR: The lid explodes upward. A corpse sits bolt upright in the ruined casket — desiccated, eyeless, wearing the rotted vestments of a Scarlattian senator dead three centuries. Its jaw unhinges with a sound like tearing leather.
THE SENATOR: He still sits the throne. He still wears the face. You dig for answers in the graves of those he's already silenced — do you think we failed for lack of TRYING?
NARRATOR: It scrambles from the hole with horrible, insectile speed and vanishes over the churchyard wall into darkness.
Silence. Then — torchlight, and the clatter of armor from the lane.
GUARD-SERGEANT: Halt! Stand where you are — all of you!
NARRATOR: Four city guards pour through the churchyard gate, halberds leveled. They see the open graves, the scattered bones, the three of you caked in dirt.
Centurion: Graverobbers and a gods-damned necromancer. On your knees, the lot of you.
FEDERICA: (quietly, to you) I will not kneel. That is not negotiable. What you do next — that is your affair.
VERHOEVEN: (setting down his shovel with great care, as though placing a child in a crib) Outstanding, Ma'am."
